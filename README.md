# C-sharp-for-Beginners
- In this repository you will find a file named [Program.cs](https://github.com/AbuTaher003/C-sharp-for-Beginners/blob/main/Program.cs), where you will get basic codes of c# in commented form. Just copy those codes and run them. Before run, you need to uncommnet them first. Thank you.
